Pass-the-Ticket attacks take aim at Kerberos much in the same way as Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket attacks, both of which exploit unfixable weaknesses in the authentication protocol.

Solutions:
Upon detecting a Pass-the-Ticket attack, your response depends on the level of access the attack provided. If the compromised account from which the TGT or service 
ticket was stolen was a low privilege account with limited or no permissions outside of the compromised system, mitigation could be as simple as resetting the userâ€™s Active Directory password.
That would invalidate the stolen TGT orservice tickets and prevent the attacker from generating new tickets using the stolen password hash.
