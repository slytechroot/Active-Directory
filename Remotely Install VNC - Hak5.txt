test connection to computer.This was tested with UltraVNC. 1.0.2 Following are the same steps with
explanations.
Step 1: Install VNC locally and set the password.
During the installation process, make sure that you check both:
- Register VNC Server as a system service
- Start the VNC system service

At the end of the installation process, you will be prompted to set a password.
The password that you set here will later be used to connect the remote PC. If
for some reason you aren't prompted for the password, run the following from the
command line:
"C:\Program Files\UltraVNC\winvnc.exe" -defaultsettingsAlso run net start from the command line and confirm VNC Server is running as a
service.
Step 2: Configure VNC on the remote PC using PsExec
PsExec is a freeware tool to execute processes on a remote PC and is needed for
this procedure:

The remote account that you use must be a member of the Administrators group on
the remote PC. "\\RemotePC" mentioned below can be either the remote PC's name
or IP address. Login to the remote PC's IPC$ share with an administrator
account. If you don't include the password in plain text, you will be prompted
to supply the password (which will not be displayed as plain text).
NET USE \\RemotePC\IPC$ /user:administrator passwordCopy your local VNC files to the remote PC.
xcopy "C:\Program Files\UltraVNC\*.*" "\\RemotePC\C$\Program Files\UltraVNC\*.*" /r/i/c/h/k/eUse Regedit to export the local VNC registry settings to the remote PC. Note: If
you prefer you can export the file locally and then copy it.
regedit /e "\\RemotePC\C$\vncdmp.txt" "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ORL"Use PsExec to import the above registry file on the remote PC.
psexec \\RemotePC -s -i -d %windir%\regedit /s C:\vncdmp.txtMake sure to use the /s switch with regedit so that confirmation isn't required
on the remote PC. You are using regedit on the remote PC to perform this
command. If the path for regedit is different on the remote PC, use the exact
path instead of %windir% Example: If the local PC is running XP Pro and the
remote PC is Windows 2000, use this command:
psexec \\RemotePC -s -i -d C:\Winnt\regedit /s C:\vncdmp.txtUse PsExec to install the remote winvnc service.
psexec \\RemotePC -s -i -d "C:\Program Files\UltraVNC\winvnc.exe" -installUse PsExec to start the remote "VNC Server" service.
psexec \\RemotePC -s -i -d net start "VNC Server"Remove registry dump file.
del \\RemotePC\C$\vncdmp.txtYou should now be able to use VNC to control the remote PC.
